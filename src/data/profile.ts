  bio: `With over 7 years of hands-on experience in software architecture, I've built and scaled systems that handle millions of requests, process complex data pipelines, and power businesses across 12+ countries.

I founded Alpha Brackets to bridge the gap between startup agility and enterprise reliability. Every system I design is built for velocity—fast to deploy, easy to scale, and resilient under pressure.

My philosophy is simple: software should never be the bottleneck. Whether you're launching an MVP or restructuring legacy infrastructure, I architect solutions that let your business move at the speed of ambition.`,
