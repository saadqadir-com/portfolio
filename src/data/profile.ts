  bio: `My journey in tech started from the ground up. Over the past 7+ years, I’ve worked day and night, evolving from Social Media Manager (where I learned what drives users) to Front-End Developer (where I mastered how to engage them) to Full-Stack Developer (where I built the systems that support them). This path provided me with a rare, 360-degree view of how business needs must be translated into technical reality.

Along the way, I watched too many ambitious startups get held back by technology built for the launch, not for the long haul. They had vision, but their foundation couldn’t keep up.

That’s why I founded Alpha Brackets. My mission is to bridge that gap. I partner directly with founders, offering strategic guidance and hands-on architecture to build future-ready systems that scale with your ambition. Over the years, I’ve helped startups scale from MVP to growth stage by architecting systems that adapt as they grow.

When I’m not scaling businesses, you’ll find me exploring the latest tech trends or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

If you’re a founder who values a partner with a builder’s mindset and a hard-earned, comprehensive perspective, let’s connect. I’d love to explore how we can build what’s next, together.`,
